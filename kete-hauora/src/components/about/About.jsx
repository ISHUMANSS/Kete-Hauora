          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            This project was created in partnership with Auckland University of Technology 
            Bachelor of Computer & Information Sciences Research & Development Project.
          </p>
          <p>
            While all due care and diligence has been taken by the students and AUT, these 
            projects are undertaken in the course of student instruction. There is no guarantee 
            of success, and clients assume a degree of risk as part of an arrangement intended 
            to be of mutual benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            On completion, it is hoped that the client will receive a professionally documented 
            and soundly constructed working software application or artefact, while students gain 
            valuable exposure to live environments and real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, the students and AUT disclaim responsibility and offer no warranty 
            regarding the technology solution or services delivered, both in relation to their 
            use and the results from their use.
